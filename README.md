## Hi, I'm Guido Naselli, a software developer from Argentina. üëãüèª

I started my programming journey in 2021, when I attended a FullStack bootcamp organized by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires. There, I learned how to build web applications using VueJS, CSS, and Spring Boot.

Since then, I have been expanding my skills and knowledge by studying Systems Analysis at university and taking online courses on NextJS, Golang, and some Python. I enjoy working with different technologies and frameworks, and I always like learning new things. My passion for programming comes from the challenge of solving problems and creating solutions that can have a positive impact. Currently, I am working full-time, focusing on Java Spring Boot and Angular, while also using PostgreSQL and Docker.

When I'm not coding, I like to play video games, exercise, watch movies or series, learn about economics or work in personal projects.
