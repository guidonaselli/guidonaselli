## Hi, I'm Guido Naselli, a software developer from Argentina. üëãüèª

I started my programming journey in 2021, when I attended a FullStack bootcamp organized by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires. There, I learned how to build web applications using VueJS, CSS, and Spring boot. 

Since then, I have been expanding my skills and knowledge by studying Systems Analysis at university and taking online courses on Django, React, Firebase, and PostgreSQL. I enjoy working with different technologies and frameworks, and I'm always eager to learn new things. My passion for programming comes from the challenge of solving problems and creating solutions that can make a positive impact.
I'm currently looking for a full-time opportunity where I can apply my skills and grow as a developer. 

When I'm not coding, I like to play video games, exercise, watch movies or series, learn about economics or work in personal projects.
